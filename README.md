# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

We can add a variety of websites and TinyApp will create a random short link for us:

!["Screen shot of the URL page"](docs/urls-page.PNG)

We can use the shortlink by adding /u/ before. For example /u/MRaysf:

!["Accessing the short link"](docs/accessing-redirect.png)

After the URL has been submitted, we are redirected to the longURL that has been stored.
