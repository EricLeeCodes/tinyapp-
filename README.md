# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

We can add a variety of websites and TinyApp will create a random short link for us:

Here is an example of adding https://stackoverflow.com/ to the list of short links:

After the URL has been submitted it has been added with a clickable short link!
